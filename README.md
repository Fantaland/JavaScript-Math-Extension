# JavaScript-Math-Extension
## Version 1.1.3!
### Published March 3rd.

An extension to the JavaScript math object.  Basically, a set of helpful math functions.  This is an ongoing and experimental project.  
If you are reading this sentence, you are witnessing the very start.
Keep in mind I am just a student, and I only work on this in my freetime... but lucky for you, I have a lot of freetime!
But really though, I have no offical education or degrees with programming, and there are no guarentees this will work or that the formulas are correct.
What I'm trying to say is if you are considering using this on a spacecraft, don't do it!
However, I think this will work (mostly) and hopefully it can help you out in some way!
My goal of this project is to help people and to have fun doing so.  Feel free to use a copy for your own project, whatever it may be.
Finally, check back for updates often, as I will be updating this somewhat frequently.
Thanks!
